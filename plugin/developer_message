<strong>APC series BX users:</strong> If you are experiencing problems with false statuses (repeated bogus low battery and/or replace battery messages) being reported by NUT, there is now a prospective fix that would need testing by the affected users. To help us fix this issue, please first update NUT and then select the "<em>preview (latest build)</em>" backend inside NUT Settings. Afterwards, either reboot your server or reinstall the plugin to apply the backend change, making sure that the NUT Backend is now displayed as either "<em>nut-2.8.2-x86_64-2master.ssl11</em>" or "<em>nut-2.8.2-x86_64-2master.ssl31</em>". If this resolves the problem for you (or not), please report back <a href="https://forums.unraid.net/topic/60217-plugin-nut-v2-network-ups-tools" target="_blank"><strong>ideally here</strong></a> (on the Unraid forums) or <a href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2347" target="_blank"><strong>alternatively here</strong></a> (in the GitHub issue) - thank you very much for your support.
