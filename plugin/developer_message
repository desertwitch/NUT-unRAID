NODISPLAY Recently there have been a number of exciting developments in the NUT master branch on GitHub. In no small part thanks to the diligent bug reports of one of our own Unraid community members, a <em>libusb</em> (one of the principal C libraries to access USB devices, as also used by NUT) maintainer has brought to the NUT project several useful improvements surrounding how NUT communicates with UPS devices via USB. These changes address a number of firmware issues on the UPS manufacturers' side and could help NUT to read better previously missing variables/parameters on such affected devices. If your UPS is suffering from missing readings, it might be worth giving the "<em>preview (latest build)</em>" backend a spin to see if there is any improvement with these latest changes (requires reinstall/reboot).
