NODISPLAYA lot of development has recently been done in preparation of future OS versions and I understand that the high frequency update cycle to NUT may have come as an inconvenience for some users.<br>Please rest assured a lot of work has been done under the hood to further smoothen the transition to OS v6.13, as well as utilizing the newly released NUT v2.8.2 and all its important changes and fixes.<br>While I cannot promise it just yet, I do hope to return to a more relaxed update cycle now unless time-sensitive fixes require more urgent attention - stability will remain the first and most important priority.
